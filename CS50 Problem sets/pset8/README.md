# Problem Set 8

This problem set entailed making a mockup website for stock trading, using Python, html, and SQL. The functionality for logging in was provided, while the rest was made by me.

The website allows for registration, if a username is not taken, logging in, showing stock quotes, buying, selling and charging the account with more "money". As it is a mockup no real currency is involved in this, but the stock prices shown are real, taken from iextrading.com
