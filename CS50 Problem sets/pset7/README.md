# Problem Set 7

This problem set entailed 2 problems, "similarities" and "survey" both of which were websites implemented in Python, using the Flask library.

Similarities was intended to take 2 text files and compare them on the basis specified by the user. "Lines" compared the files line by line. "Sentences" compared the files sentence by sentence. "Substrings" compared the files based on the length of substrings specified by the user. The website functionality was provided, and the main aim was to implement helpers.py which was responsible for comparing the files correctly.

Survey was intended to be a simple survey website that takes input from the user, saves it to a csv file, and redirects the user to a table with all the answers provided by other users.
