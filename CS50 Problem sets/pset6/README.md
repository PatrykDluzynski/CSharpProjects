Vigenere "encrypts" a message by taking a word as a key from the user, and then asking for some plaintext as user input. It then iterates through each letter of the plaintext and through each letter of the key. It then shifts the plaintext by a number corresponding to the place in the alphabet of the current letter of the key.
