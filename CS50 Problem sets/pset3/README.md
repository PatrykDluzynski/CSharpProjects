# Problem Set 3

This problem set entailed "recover" and "resize"

Recover was a program that was intended to cycle through raw data saved on a memory card and recover the images saved on it, by writing them to .jpg files. The data was provided, while the program was written by me.

Resize was intended to increase the size of an image by the factor of a value specified by the user, up to 100. Recover.c was written by me, while the bmp.h header file was provided.
