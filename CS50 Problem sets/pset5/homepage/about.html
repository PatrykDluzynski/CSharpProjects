            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>My name is Patryk Dluzynski, and I am 22 years old. I was born in Poland, but have been living in Ireland since I was 9!</p>
            <h1>My hobbies and interests</h1>
            <p>My main hobby is pc gaming. As my parents have told me I've been gaming almost since I was born. My favourite game of all time is Hollow Knight.</p>
            <p>While gaming is partially the reason why I started to learn how to program, my ultimate goal is to learn how to create machine learning algorithms and hopefully build a career around them.</p>
            <p>I also love listening to music, especially electronic, and "chill" genres, and my favourite artist is Gramatik.</p>
            <p>Physics and chemistry interest me as well, and I finished a 4 year course in Nanoscience in Trinity College, Dublin, but ultimately found that I'm more interested in computer science.</p>
