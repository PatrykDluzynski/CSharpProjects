# Cats and Dogs ML

This is a website I made as a final project for the CS50 course

It consists of a Convolutional Neural Network, the iterations of which are in the models folder.
The CNN that worked best had 4 layers of 64 neurons, which then fed into a single dense layer of 64 neurons, and then into a single output layer, with a single neuron

I then built a website around it that allows for file uploads, feeds them through the algorithm and returns them along with the prediction.
